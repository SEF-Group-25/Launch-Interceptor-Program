# Essence state assessment
Reflecting on our current state, we would think that we are in the **In use** state, but we meet most of the criteria for **in place**. 

## Principles Established
We don't have any real stakeholders so all the points reflecting those are moot. We have agreed on a context, what tools we will be using for development, and the constraints. Most of this has been outlined for us in the assignment or course in general but never less has been seen and is known. We can confidently say we are past the "Principles Established" state. 

## Foundation Established
We are currently working and have been for the better part of a week and feel that it has been properly established at this point. The non-negotiable (as outlined by our assignment like testing and requirements) have been set up and tasks have been divided. Capability gaps have been accounted for and are understood for the most part by each member. Such as varied experience in programming, structure or languages, testing, and experience in expected, workflow. 
We feel safe to assert that we are on or past the "Foundation established" state.

## In use
We are currently doing work applying our practices and tools (such as testing and CI). There has not been enough time to regularly inspect the use of tools a practices but they have been within our time frame. The team is supporting the practice and tools and is actively using them has to a necessary ability been adapt to the team (establishing communications channels). We however do not have an established procedure in place to to handle feedback on the teamâ€™s way of working, which is something we have to work on. The practices and tools do seem to establish team communication though, although this is also an avenue that we will have to wait and see as we work more together. We feel that we are currently in the "in use" state and where we need to wait and see what areas we are lacking in as they will most likely appear as we work together. Our initial thoughts are that checks relating to communication and feedback should be our focus.

## In place
Everyone has access to our tools and principles, and are being used by the whole team. Everyone has been involved in adapting the tools and practices when we held group meetings or early on when we were still figuring things out while working. We feel that, if we manage to get past the "in use" stage, then we will probably quickly be able to move past the "in place" stage and move to focus on "working well"

## Working well
Most of our team are new to the tools and practices so we can't say that we fill any of the boxes in this category. We believe our next best course of action would be to spend a bit more time with our practices and tools to then later re-evaluate how well we are doing with this state.
